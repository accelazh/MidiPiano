Many synthesizers are multimbral (sometimes called polytimbral), meaning that they can play the notes of different instruments simultaneously. (Timbre is the characteristic sound quality that enables a listener to distinguish one kind of musical instrument from other kinds.) Multimbral synthesizers can emulate an entire ensemble of real-world instruments, instead of only one instrument at a time. MIDI synthesizers normally implement this feature by taking advantage of the different MIDI channels on which the MIDI specification allows data to be transmitted. In this case, the synthesizer is actually a collection of sound-generating units, each emulating a different instrument and responding independently to messages that are received on a different MIDI channel. Since the MIDI specification provides only 16 channels, a typical MIDI synthesizer can play up to 16 different instruments at once. The synthesizer receives a stream of MIDI commands, many of which are channel commands. (Channel commands are targeted to a particular MIDI channel; for more information, see the MIDI specification.) If the synthesizer is multitimbral, it routes each channel command to the correct sound-generating unit, according to the channel number indicated in the command.
