As orientation for all this API, the next section explains some of the basics of MIDI synthesis and how they're reflected in the Java Sound API. Subsequent sections give a more detailed look at the API.
Understanding MIDI Synthesis

How does a synthesizer generate sound? Depending on its implementation, it may use one or more sound-synthesis techniques. For example, many synthesizers use wavetable synthesis. A wavetable synthesizer reads stored snippets of audio from memory, playing them at different sample rates and looping them to create notes of different pitches and durations. For example, to synthesize the sound of a saxophone playing the note C#4 (MIDI note number 61), the synthesizer might access a very short snippet from a recording of a saxophone playing the note Middle C (MIDI note number 60), and then cycle repeatedly through this snippet at a slightly faster sample rate than it was recorded at, which creates a long note of a slightly higher pitch. Other synthesizers use techniques such as frequency modulation (FM), additive synthesis, or physical modeling, which don't make use of stored audio but instead generate audio from scratch using different algorithms.
