What all synthesis techniques have in common is the ability to create many sorts of sounds. Different algorithms, or different settings of parameters within the same algorithm, create different-sounding results. An instrument is a specification for synthesizing a certain type of sound. That sound may emulate a traditional musical instrument, such as a piano or violin; it may emulate some other kind of sound source, for instance, a telephone or helicopter; or it may emulate no "real-world" sound at all. A specification called General MIDI defines a standard list of 128 instruments, but most synthesizers allow other instruments as well. Many synthesizers provide a collection of built-in instruments that are always available for use; some synthesizers also support mechanisms for loading additional instruments.

An instrument may be vendor-specific¡ªin other words, applicable to only one synthesizer or several models from the same vendor. This incompatibility results when two different synthesizers use different sound-synthesis techniques, or different internal algorithms and parameters even if the fundamental technique is the same. Because the details of the synthesis technique are often proprietary, incompatibility is common. The Java Sound API includes ways to detect whether a given synthesizer supports a given instrument.
